# Getting started with Blocks
Let's code your first simulation robot in SoccerSim! First, open up https://rcjnsw.github.io/soccersim/javascript. On the left, you have an editor, where you can program JavaScript code. On the right, you have the simulation.

JavaScript is pretty similar to C or Python - it just has a slightly different syntax. The following links may be helpful:
