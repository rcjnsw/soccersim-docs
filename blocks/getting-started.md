# Getting started with Blocks
Let's code your first simulation robot in SoccerSim! First, open up https://rcjnsw.github.io/soccersim/blocks. On the left, you have a Scratch-like drag and drop area, where you can click and drag on blocks and place them into the workspace.

On the right, you have the simulation.
